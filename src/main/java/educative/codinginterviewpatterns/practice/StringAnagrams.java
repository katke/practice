  * Given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

  * Every anagram is a permutation of a string. As we know, when we are not allowed to repeat
  * characters while finding permutations of a string, we get N! permutations (or anagrams) of a
  * string having N characters. For example, here are the six anagrams of the string “abc”:
  abc
  acb
  bac
  bca
  cab
  cba
  * Write a function to return a list of starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the given string.
